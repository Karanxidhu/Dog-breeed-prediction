# Dog-breeed-prediction

To do this, we'll be using data from the Kaggle dog breed identification competition. It consists of a collection of 10,000+ labelled images of 120 different dog breeds.

For this model, I am using `imagenet/mobilenet_v2_130_224/classification` from TensorFlow Hub

It is sample notebook of model trained on small data (1000 images only), you can train it further on full Data
